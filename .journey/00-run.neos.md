# Serverless Journey: Run a freshly built container image on Cloud Run

![Tutorial header image](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/retail_2022_XfdMe3d.max-700x700.jpg)

In this tutorial we'll learn how to remotely build a container image from source code, store the image in Artifact Registry and deploy it to Cloud Run. After that, we'll familiarize ourselves with the Cloud Run UI, it's API and explore some of the available options to tweak our service.

## Project setup

First, let's make sure we've got the correct project selected. Go ahead and select the provided project ID.

<walkthrough-project-setup billing="true"></walkthrough-project-setup>

<walkthrough-enable-apis apis="cloudbuild.googleapis.com,
run.googleapis.com,
artifactregistry.googleapis.com">
</walkthrough-enable-apis>

## Exploring the code

Take some time and 
<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="cloudshell_open/serverless/main.go">
familiarize yourself with the code.
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>

Also have a look at the dependencies reference in the GO module. You can navigate to it's [upstream repository](https://github.com/helloworlddan/tortune) to figure out what it does.

Once you've understood what's going on, you can try to run that app directly in Cloud Shell, running the following in the terminal:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This compiles and starts the web server. You can now use Cloud Shell Web Preview on port 8080 to check out your application. You can find the Web Preview <walkthrough-web-preview-icon></walkthrough-web-preview-icon> at the top right in Cloud Shell.

Finally, focus the terminal again and terminate the web server with `Ctrl-C`.

## Building and deploying the code

We established that our code runs locally, great! Let's put in on the cloud.

<!-- TODO, verify OCI -->
In the following steps, we'll deploy our app to Cloud Run, which is a compute platform for running modern, cloud-first, containerized applications. Cloud Run schedules and runs container images that expose services over HTTP. You can use any programming language or framework, as long as you can bind an HTTP server on a port provided by the `$PORT` environment variable.  Please note, that container images must be in Docker or OCI format and will be run on Linux x86_64.

Cloud Run is available in all Google Cloud Platform regions globally. If you are unsure where to deploy to, you can use the [Region Picker](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/region-picker/) tool to find the most suitable one.

You can configure project and preferred regions and zones in `gcloud` to make its invocation more convenient.

```bash
gcloud config set project <walkthrough-project-id/>
gcloud config set run/region europe-north1 
gcloud config set artifacts/location europe-north1 
```

Note that our code is not yet build or containerized, but Cloud Run requires that.
The `gcloud` CLI has a convenient short cut for deploying Cloud Run which quickly allows us to do so.

We can use a single command to easily:
- tarball a directory (build context)
- upload it to Google Cloud Storage
- use Cloud Build to untar the context, build the app, containerize and store it on Artifact Registry
- create a new Cloud Run service with a fresh revision
- bind an IAM policy to the the service
- route traffic to the new endpoint

```bash
gcloud run deploy jokes --source .
```

The command requires additional information and hence switches to an interactive mode. You can have a look at the `gcloud` CLI [reference](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/deploy) in case some of the option may be unclear to you.

We want our application to be publicly available on the internet.

Wait for the deployment to finish and then navigate to the `*.a.run.app` endpoint it created. You should be able to call the endpoint from your browser or by using any other HTTP client like cURL.

Next, let's use `gcloud` to retrieve the auto-generated service URL and then `curl` it:

```bash
curl $(gcloud run services describe jokes --format 'value(status.url)')
```

Cloud Run services consist of one or more revisions. Whenever you update your service or it's configuration, you are creating a new revision. Revisions are immutable.

Navigate to the [Cloud Run section in the Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/run) to explore the service and its active revision.

Building from `--source` uses Google Cloud Buildpacks. Buildpacks are predefined archetypes that take your application source code and transform it into production-ready container images without any additional boilerplate (e.g. a Dockerfile).
[Learn more about supported languages for Buildpacks](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying-source-code).

## Using Cloud Code 

Alternatively, you can deploy and otherwise manage the life cycle of your Cloud Run services and other resources using Cloud Code.

Cloud Code is an IDE plugin for both VS Code and Intellj-based IDEs and is designed to make you interaction with Google Cloud more convenient.

Cloud Code is a pre-installed in Cloud Shell.

Click the
<walkthrough-editor-spotlight spotlightId="activity-bar-cloud-code">
Cloud Code icon in the activity bar
</walkthrough-editor-spotlight>
to expand it.

Within the activity bar
<walkthrough-editor-spotlight spotlightId="cloud-code-cloud-run-deploy">
you can directly deploy to Cloud Run
</walkthrough-editor-spotlight>
too, with out the need to use the CLI.

Take a moment and familiarize yourself with the wizard and explore the previously deployed revision. Use the Cloud Code wizard to deploy a new revision of the server and **set the allocated memory to 256m**.

## Scaling you app

Cloud Run automatically scales your application based how many web requests are coming in via the HTTPS endpoint. Cloud Run's horizontal auto-scaler is extremely fast and can launch 100s of new instances in seconds.

Let's put some load on our newly created service and learn about scaling while we wait. We'll start by pushing 500.000 requests using `hey`:

```bash
hey -n 5000000 $(gcloud run services describe jokes --format 'value(status.url)')
```

In order to build modern, cloud-first applications that scale well horizontally, we need to watch out for some design considerations.

**Applications should be engineered to boot quickly.** Cloud Run can start your containers very quickly, but it is your responsibility to bring up a web server and you should engineer your code to do so quickly. The earlier this happens, the earlier Cloud Run is able to route HTTP requests to the new instance, reduce stress on the older instances and hence scale out effectively. Cloud Run considers the life cycle stage from starting your application to the moment it can serve HTTP requests as 'Startup'. During this time Cloud Run will periodically check if your application has bound the port provided by `$PORT` and if so, Cloud Run considers startup complete and routes live traffic to the new instance. Depending on your application code, you can further cut down startup time by enabling _Startup CPU boost_. When enabled, Cloud Run will temporarily allocate additional CPU resources during startup of your application.

**Applications should ideally be stateless.** Cloud Run will also automatically scale in again, should application traffic decrease. Container instances will be terminated, if Cloud Run determines that too many are active to deal with the current request load. When an instance is scheduled for termination, Cloud Run will change it's life cycle stage to 'Shutdown'. You can trap the `SIGTERM` signal in your code and begin graceful shutdown of your instance. Requests will no longer be routed to your container and your application has 10 seconds to persist data over the network, flush caches or complete some other remaining write operations.

**Applications are generally request-driven**. During the 'Startup' and 'Shutdown' stages of each container life cycle, your application can expect to be able to fully use the allocated CPU. During the 'Serving' life cycle, the CPU is only available when there is at least one active request being processed on a container instance. If there is no active request on the instance, Cloud Run will throttle the CPU and use it elsewhere. You will not be charged for CPU time if it's throttled. Occasionally, you might create applications that require a CPU to be always available, for instance when running background services. In this scenario, you want to switch from Cloud Run's default _CPU allocated during requests_ to the alternative mode _CPU always allocated_. Note that this will also switch Cloud Run to a [different pricing model](https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing#tables). The following diagram shows the two pricing models and their effect on how CPUs are throttled throughout the life cycle of a container instance.

[![Cloud Run container life cycle and CPU throttling](https://cloud.google.com/static/run/docs/images/run-cpu-allocation.svg)](https://cloud.google.com/static/run/docs/images/run-cpu-allocation.svg)

Deploy a new revision using the [Cloud Run section in the Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/run/deploy/europe-north1/jokes) and **enable Startup CPU boost**. 

While you are in the Google Cloud Console, have a look at [the metrics section of your service](https://console.cloud.google.com/run/detail/europe-north1/jokes/metrics) and explore how the previously executed load test affected scaling.

## Summary

You now have a good feel for what it means to build and deploy your code to Cloud Run.
